# Week 7

## Summary:
This week we integrated Dave onto a chatbot in order to better demonstrate Dave's ability to take an input of a sentence from the user, and the response in a written form. We explored numerous existing chatbot solutions, including Messenger bot, Telegram Bot and a few others. At the end, Slack bot is the one we decided to go ahead with due to its ease-to-use API and friendly user-interface.

One issue we ran into was that in certain scenarios Dave would respond more than once after an user input and that causes the inaccuracy of responses. I've fixed the issue by restricting Dave's response to be made strictly after a human user, instead of everyone in the communication channel.

## Next week:
Explore genetics and bruteforce approach in order to determine the most efficient way to achieve better semantic similarities.
