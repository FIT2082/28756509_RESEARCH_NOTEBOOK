# Week 6

## Summary:
This week Dylan and I conducted a survey consist of two topics, weather and objects within the lab, which is intended to collect questions people would potentially ask Dave, in order to improve Dave's accuracy of responses. We collected over 35 responses for each topic, and the findings were interesting. Majority of the sample questions provided by people are vastly similar, and in fact identical once punctuations and captilisations of the sentences are removed. It is especially useful in understanding the potential questions as it makes us to better prepare for the real world scenario.

## Next week:
Continue exploring POS tagging and continue collecting potential questions people might ask.
