# Week 2

# Summary:
Dylan and I have been allocated into the project "Teaching Dave English" under the supervision of Dilpreet Singh and Professor Jon McCormack.

## Project summary
Dave is a mobile robot that has been developed and constructed at SensiLab. He's been created to give tours of our research space and also serve as a research platform for embedded AI. Dave, being an intelligent robot, is capable of seeing, hearing, and speaking. For this project, we are looking to improve Dave's ability to understand and parse natural language.

## Meeting
We met up with Dilpreet at SensiLab on Wednesday to get a better idea of the scope of the project. At the moment Dave has no semantic understanding of words, as a result the responses triggered are not as accurate as we desired. The concrete goals for this project is to have use semantic similarity to improve the response accuracy, and for the robot to be able to extract entities from an input, and ultimately have the software model run on-device in almost real-time. At the end of the meeting, we have decided to have a weekly meetup at SensiLab every Wednesday with our supervisor, as well as a weekly meetup with my partner Dylan in our own time to work on the project together.

# Next week:
Dylan and I will be exploring different exisiting solutions/software packages that we could potentially use for the project. We will also work on the project proposal which will be due at the end of next week.
