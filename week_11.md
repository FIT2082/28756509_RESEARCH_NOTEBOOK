# Week 11

## Summary:
This week we packed up everything we'll need for upcoming presentation and demo in week 12. The Slack bot has been integrated with the new NLTK package containing the new corpus. We have added an additional classification called "greeting" which contains some sample sentences people might say to Dave for greeting.

I have also started designing a poster layout for next week's presentation.

## Next week:
Finish up the poster and get it printed before next Friday. Two minutes pitch will also need to be written.
