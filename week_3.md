# Week 3

## Summary:
Dilpreet has demonstrated to us Dave's current state, and from what we observed and the information provided by Dilpreet, the findings can be summarised as below.

### Current state
- Ability to vectorise the corpus and remove stop words & common words
- Ability to calculate term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) for each of the words using TfidfVectorizer module in the sklearn Python package
- Speech is converted to text using Microsoft Azure's Speech to Text API
- Space is limited to 4GB and as a result Dave runs out of space very quickly

## Next week:
Dylan and I will continue to explore different potential methods which we can tackle this project, and at the same time finishing up our project proposal which the submission date has been pushed back to Friday week 4.
