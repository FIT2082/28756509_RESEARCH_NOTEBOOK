# Week 10

## Summary:
This week, I created another survey using Google Forms collecting responses from people with little to none background in machine learning to ensure the survey conducted is fair and as close to real-world scenario as possible. Questions were asked to collect possible questions sensiLab visitors might ask Dave. Topics include: objects, date/time, paint, news and events. At the end of the week, over 35 unique responses were collected for each topic, which I've then compiled into a csv file with required format for Dylan to use as test data.

## Next week:
Implement the Slack bot with the new model Dylan and I built, in order to prepare for week 12 presentation.
