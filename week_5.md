# Week 5

## Summary:
Dylan and I explored NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) which is a platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. Sentences were able to be broken down into small parts which a parse tree can then be displayed to show the structure of the input sentence and identity Parts of Speech (POS) within the sentence.

At the moment the POS tagging feature is not 100% accurate and we are looking to further improve it in the following weeks.

## Next week:
Continue exploring POS tagging, look into speech-to-text & text-to-speech services which could be potentially implemented onto Dave to improve accuracy of speech recognition.
